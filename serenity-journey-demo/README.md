## Serenity Journey Demo

The `serenity-journey-demo` sub-project that was here has now been deleted. 

There is a more comprehensive and up to date [external project](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/screenplay-pattern-todomvc) that contains examples of:
* [Screenplay working in conjunction with JUnit](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/screenplay-pattern-todomvc#screenplay-and-junit)
* [Screenplay working in conjunction with Cucumber](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/screenplay-pattern-todomvc#screenplay-and-cucumber)
